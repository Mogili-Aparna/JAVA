"Class,Primary Purpose,How It Works,Key Advantages,Best Used For"
"`FileWriter`,Writes characters to a file.,Directly writes characters to the file system.,Simple to use; straightforward for basic file writing.,Writing small amounts of text to a file when performance isn't a major concern."
"`BufferedWriter`,Improves performance through buffering.,Wraps another `Writer` (like `FileWriter`) to collect characters in an in-memory buffer before writing them to the underlying stream in a single, larger chunk.,Dramatically improves performance by reducing costly disk I/O operations, especially for large files or many small writes.,Any scenario where you are writing a significant amount of data to a file."
"`PrintWriter`,Writes formatted text.,Provides convenient `print()`, `println()`, and `printf()` methods for writing formatted data (including primitive types and objects) to an output stream.,Easy to use, automatically handles line terminators, and can write various data types without explicit conversion. Exceptions are swallowed, requiring the use of `checkError()` to detect issues.,Writing formatted output, such as text reports, logs, or for simple console output (`System.out`)."
